</font></p>
<p><font size="3.5"> I explore how agents sustain mutually beneficial
cooperative relations in adverse contexts. Illegal online marketplaces
(cryptomarkets) present a unique context for studying the emergence of
cooperation in a context where legal controls are absent, social actors
are highly anonymous, and the overall levels of trust are low. With
collaborators, I study how socio-technical solutions (such as reputation
systems) and informal mechanisms of social control (such as gossip)
allow individuals to establish trade in such adverse extra-legal

<p><font size = "2.5"> In this work, we explore how reputation-based
online markets have shifted the role that psychological mechanisms play
in promoting mutually cooperative market exchange from the stage of
exchange to the stage of sharing information about other traders in the
market. We use text mining to infer reasons traders had for sharing
reputation information about other traders in illegal online
marketplaces and zoom in on the essential tole of moral norms in solving
the second-order cooperation problem in large-scale anonymous internet

<p><font size = "2.5"><em>With Wojtek Przepiorka and Vincent Buskens, In
preparation.</em></font></p>
<font size = "2.5"> Sharing of reputational information in large-scale
online markets has been mainly delegated to socio-technical solutions
such as reputation systems. Reputation systems have been shown to
incentivize trustworthy trader behavior by collecting and transmitting
information about trader reputations. However, beyond relying on
quantitative scores in reputation systems, traders in online markets
make use of informal community spaces for interactive, gossip-like
production of information about trader reputations. We show how
reputation information shared in informal communities helps govern
online markets for illegal goods through two mechanisms. We combine
manual text coding and deep learning language models to complement data
on hundreds of thousands of market transactions with sentiments
extracted from 1.6 million community texts written about traders in two
illegal online markets. First, we find that reputational information
shared in informal communities complements formalized reputation
systems, thereby supporting informal social control. Second, we observe
that community-generated information helps platform administrators to
exhibit formal control by identifying and excluding untrustworthy
sellers from the marketplace. We show how, beyond reliance on
sophisticated reputation systems that quantify reputations, traders
still rely on informal, gossip-like discussions when governing
cooperative exchanges in online markets. Our work sheds light on the
ecosystem of bottom-up and top-down mechanisms of social control in
large-scale anonymous market environments. </font>

<p><font size="5.5"> Norm emergence and change </font></p>
<p><font size = "3.5"> I am interested in how norms emerge to promote or
block sucesfull cooperation in societies. In a project with
collaborators, I use agent-based models to explore how norms that signal
group belonging emerge to solve cooperation problems in contexts where
multiple groups with conflicting interests encounter each other. In such
contexts, signalling one’s group behaviour can help establish parochial
cooperation and benefit exploited minority groups. I am further
interested in understanding conditions under which such signalling norms
become inefficient and damage the well-being of the groups that enforce
them. </font></p>

<p><font size="3.5"> <strong>Signals of Belonging: Emergence of
Signalling Norms as Facilitators of Trust and Parochial Cooperation
</strong> </font> <br/></p>
<p><font size = "2.5"><em>With Milena Tsvetkova, Wojtek Przepiorka, and
Vincent Buskens.</em></font> </br> <font size = "2.5">Article
forthcoming in <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society
B</em>, doi: 10.1098/rstb.2023.0029. Preprint available <a
href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/acr82/">here</a></font></p>
<p><font size = "2.5"> Mechanisms of social control reinforce norms that
appear harmful or wasteful, such as mutilation practices or extensive
body tattoos. We suggest such norms arise to serve as signals that
distinguish between ingroup “friends” and outgroup “foes”, facilitating
parochial cooperation. Combining insights from research on signalling
and parochial cooperation, we incorporate a trust game with signalling
in an agent-based model to study the dynamics of signalling norm
emergence in groups with conflicting interests. Our results show that
costly signalling norms emerge from random acts of signalling in
minority groups that benefit most from parochial cooperation. Majority
groups are less likely to develop costly signalling norms. Yet, norms
that prescribe sending costless group identity signals can easily emerge
in groups of all sizes – albeit, at times, at the expense of minority
group members. Further, the dynamics of signalling norm emergence differ
across signal costs, relative group sizes, and levels of ingroup
assortment. Our findings provide theoretical insights into norm
evolution in contexts where groups develop identity markers in response
to environmental challenges that put their interests at odds with the
interests of other groups. Such contexts arise in zones of ethnic
conflict or during contestations of existing power relations.</p>

<p><font size="5.5"> Networks, culture, innovation and inequality
</font></p>
<p><font size="3.5"> I am intrigued by how the structure of social
networks affects outcomes in different social groups and communities. On
the one hand, I am interested in how social network structure and
cultural integration affect the capacity of (online) communities to
develop shared culture and innovate. On the other hand, I am also
intrigued by how numerical properties of different social groups
engaging ininteractions with each other can lead to structural
inequalities.</p>

<p><font size="3.5"> <strong>“I Heard it on the (Silk)Road”: Structural
and Cultural Pathways to Novelty Introduction in an Online Community
</strong> </font> <br/></p>
<p><font size="2.5"><em>With Damiano Morando, In
preparation.</em></font></p>
<p><font size = "2.5"> Online communities play a crucial role in
generating and spreading innovation which affects both the online and
offline world. Yet, we still know relatively little about the members
who introduce novelty into the community - innovators. We explore the
structural and cultural embeddedness of members who introduce linguistic
and knowledge-based innovations into a large online forum. First, we
find that the effect of being structurally embedded in the community is
moderated by the content one is exposed to. That is, less embedded
individuals (i.e., brokers) benefit from access to diverse content in
the online community;while embedded individuals benefit from seeing
similar content.Second, we show that being culturally embedded in the
community has an inverse U shape effect over the likelihood introducing
an innovation. We find evidence for the tension between the
norm-following required for meaningful innovations and the norm-breaking
that pushes one to “think outside of the box”. </font></p>

inequity-reducing strategies in homophilic networks</strong> </font>
<br/></p>
<p><font size = "2.5"><em>With Sam Zhang, In
preparation.</em></font></p>
<p><font size = "2.5"> Minorities are often disadvantaged in social
networks, and their disadvantage can arise in the presence of two
ubiquitous features of social networks: homophily and preferential
attachment. This disadvantage often translates to less visibility and
lower access to valuable social capital of minority group members. In
this paper, we use the directed network model with preferential
attachment and homophily (DPAH) to evaluate how minority groups fare in
the presence of additional groups that could bridge the
majority/minority gap, such as majority group members who support the
minority group (allies), and minority group members that are
incorporated into the majority group. Our results show that the marginal
benefit of majority group members becoming allies increases with
minority group size, and larger minority groups reach equity with a
smaller proportion of incorporated members. These results suggest that
interventions on structural inequities on networks can depend
sensitively on the relative sizes of the groups involved. Our models
also reveal the increasing difficulty of a minority group achieving
parity as the group shrinks. </font></p>

<p><font size = "2.5"> The emergence of big data and computational tools
has introduced new possibilities for using large-scale textual sources
in sociological research. Recent work in sociology of culture, science,
and economic sociology has shown how computational text analysis can be
used in theory building and testing. This review starts with an
introduction of the history of computer-assisted text analysis in
sociology and then proceeds to discuss five families of computational
methods used in contemporary research. Using exemplary studies, it shows
how dictionary methods, semantic and network analysis tools, language
models, unsupervised, and supervised machine learning can assist
sociologists with different analytical tasks. After presenting recent
methodological developments, this review summarizes several important
implications of using large datasets and computational methods to infer
complex meaning in texts. Finally, it calls researchers from different
methodological traditions to adopt text mining tools while remaining
mindful of lessons learned from working with conventional data and
methods. </font></p>

<p><font size = "2.5"> Short texts generated by individuals in online
environments can provide social and behavioural scientists with rich
insights into individual internal states. We assess the performance of a
broad set of approaches from two families of text mining methods to
capture individuals’ motives, norms, emotions, and stances. The
benchmark for our assessment are posts from various online platforms
that were coded by humans based on theoretically informed coding
schemes. We find that dictionary methods that are frequently used in the
social and behavioural sciences provide unsatisfactory performance. We
further assess the performance of several cutting edge supervised
machine learning methods. We find that transformer language models
approach our benchmark, but sometimes provide little improvement
compared to simpler methods. Our analyses rely exclusively on accessible
and flexible open-source transformer models. We discuss the strengths
and weaknesses of transformer models and address questions related to
tradeoffs between complexity and performance in social and behavioral
science applications. More broadly, we describe challenges arising when
using different text mining approaches and provide best-practice advice.

Hype!</strong> </font> <br/></p>
<p><font size = "2.5"><em>With Etienne Ollion, Rubing Shen and Arnault
Chatelain, Under Review. Preprint available <a
href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x58kn/">here</a>.</em></font></p>
<p><font size = "2.5"> In the past months, researchers have
enthusiastically discussed the relevance of zero- or few-shot
classifiers like ChatGPT for text annotation. Should these models prove
to be performant, they would open up new continents for research,and
beyond. To assess the merits and limits of this approach, we conducted a
systematic literature review. Reading all the articles doing zero or
few-shot text annotation in the human and social sciences, we found that
these few-shot learners offer enticing, yet mixed results on text
annotation tasks. The performance scores can vary widely, with some
being average and some being very low. Besides, zero or few-shot models
are often outperformed by models fine-tuned with human annotations. Our
findings thus suggest that, to date, the evidence about their
effectiveness remains partial, but also that their use raises several
important questions about the reproducibility of results, about privacy
and copyright issues, and about the primacy of the English language.
While we definitely believe that there are numerous ways to harness this
powerful technology productively, we also need to harness it without
falling for the hype.</font></p>
