I am currently working on developing an R package enabling researchers
to explore their textual corpora using several measures from 
computational linguistics.

These measures enable one to explore the "key" words in one corpus, compared to 
the other, exploring important concepts over text categories, time, etc. 

Current version, still under development, can be found on my
[GitHub page](https://github.com/amacanovic/KeynessMeasures).
