I am a PhD Candidate in Sociology at the Department of Sociology, Utrecht 
University (UU) and the Interuniversity Center for Social Science Theory and 
Methodology [(ICS)](http://ics-graduateschool.nl/).


My PhD research is concerned with cooperation of agents in extra-legal 
environments and the potential negative consequences of such cooperation. 
Currently, I am exploring the functioning of reputation systems in cryptomarkets 
utilizing automatic text analysis. I am working under the supervision of [dr. 
Wojtek Przepiorka](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/WPrzepiorka) and 
[prof.dr. Vincent Buskens](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/vbuskens). 


I have a BA in Sociology (Track: Economics) from the University of Belgrade and 
a MSc in Economics (Track: Behavioural Economics and Game Theory) from the 
University of Amsterdam.
