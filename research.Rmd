<font size="5.5"> Cooperation and trust in extra-legal contexts </font>
  
<font size="3.5"> I explore how agents sustain mutually beneficial cooperative
  relations in adverse contexts. Illegal 
  online marketplaces (cryptomarkets) present a unique context for studying
  the emergence of cooperation in a context where legal controls are absent,
  social actors are highly anonymous, and the overall levels of trust are low.
  With collaborators, I study how socio-technical solutions (such as reputation systems) and 
  informal mechanisms of social control (such as gossip) allow individuals to 
  establish trade in such adverse extra-legal environments.

  <font size="3.5"> **The Moral Embeddedness of Illegal Markets** </font>

  In this work, we explore how reputation-based online markets have shifted the 
    role that psychological mechanisms play in promoting mutually cooperative
    market exchange from the stage of exchange to the stage of sharing information
    about other traders in the market. We use text mining to infer reasons traders
    had for sharing reputation information about other traders in illegal online marketplaces 
    and zoom in on the essential tole of moral norms in solving the
    second-order cooperation problem in large-scale anonymous internet marketplaces.

<font size = "2.5">
    In complex societies with increasing role specialization
    social control moves from the interpersonal to impersonal by 
    being delegated to specially chosen agents and formalized institutions. The case 
    of  online marketplaces where hundreds of thousands geographically 
    distant anonymous traders engage in transactions showcases the success of socio-technical
    solutions in supporting large-scale cooperation. In these markets, specially
    delegated administrators, buyer protection technologies, and formalized reputation 
    systems enforce sanctions against untrustworthy traders. Yet, it remains unclear 
    whether informal information sharing through gossip still plays an important role in enforcing 
    (informal) social control in such technologically advanced marketplaces. In this work, we explore
    the interaction of gossip as a means of informal social control and more formalized
    socio-technical control systems existing in online markets.

<font size="5.5"> Norm emergence and change </font>
  
<font size = "3.5"> I am interested in how norms emerge to promote or block
sucesfull cooperation in societies. In a project with collaborators, I use agent-based 
models to explore how norms that signal group belonging emerge to solve cooperation problems
in contexts where multiple groups with conflicting interests encounter each other.
In such contexts, signalling one's group behaviour can help establish parochial
cooperation and benefit exploited minority groups. I am further interested in understanding 
conditions under which such signalling norms  become inefficient and 
damage the well-being of the groups that enforce them.

  <font size="3.5"> **Signals of Belonging: Emergence of Signalling Norms as Facilitators of Parochial Cooperation ** </font>
  <br/>  
    
<font size = "2.5">*With Milena Tsvetkova, Wojtek Przepiorka, and Vincent Buskens, In preparation.*</font>
    
<font size = "2.5">
Mechanisms of social control at times reinforce norms that appear individually, or even collectively, harmful or “wasteful” – such as mutilation practices or extensive body tattoos. This project explores the suggestion that such norms emerge as outcomes of signalling games and promote parochial cooperation in contexts where different groups
have conflicting interests. To understand when signalling norms emerge as solutions to the trust problem arising in such environments, we build an agent-based model based on the trust game with signalling: in this game, signalling can help individuals reveal their group membership to others they are encountering – and thus enforce and sustain
parochial cooperation.

<font size="5.5"> Networks, culture, innovation and inequality </font>
  
<font size="3.5"> I am intrigued by how the structure of social networks affects 
outcomes in different social groups and communities. On the one hand, I am
interested in how social network structure and cultural integration affect
the capacity of (online) communities to produce innovation. On the other hand, I am
also intrigued by how numerical properties of different social groups engaging in 
interactions with each other can lead to structural inequalities.

<font size="3.5"> **I Heard it on the (Silk)Road: Who Introduces
Innovations in Online Communities?** </font>
  <br/>  
    
  <font size="2.5">*With Damiano Morando, In preparation.*</font>
    
  <font size = "2.5">
Online communities play a crucial role in generating and spreading innovation
which affects both the online and offline world. Yet, despite knowing a lot about
the reasons propelling individuals to join them, we still know relatively little
about the members who introduce novelty into the community - innovators. We explore 
the structural and cultural embeddedness of members who introduce linguistic and 
knowledge-based innovations into a large online forum. We find evidence of the 
importance of network brokerage for one's innovative potential and conclude that
cultural embeddedness promotes innovativeness - but only to a certain extent; 
being too culturally embedded, on the other hand, impedes on one's capacity to 
introduce new ideas.

<font size="3.5"> **Minority group size moderates inequity-reducing strategies in homophilic networks** </font>
  <br/>  
    
<font size = "2.5">*With Sam Zhang and Travis Holmes, In preparation.*</font>
    
<font size = "2.5">
  
Minorities are often disadvantaged in social networks, and their disadvantage
can arise in the presence of two ubiquitous features of social networks: homophily
and preferential attachment. This disadvantage often translates to less visibility
and lower access to valuable social capital of minority group members. In this 
paper, we use the directed network model with preferential attachment and homophily 
(DPAH) to evaluate how minority groups fare in the presence of additional groups
that could bridge the majority/minority gap, such as majority group members who 
support the minority group (allies), and minority group members that are incorporated 
into the majority group. Our results show that the marginal benefit of majority group
members becoming allies increases with minority group size, and larger minority 
groups reach equity with a smaller proportion of incorporated members. 
These results suggest that interventions on structural inequities on networks 
can depend sensitively on the relative sizes of the groups involved. 
Our models also reveal the increasing difficulty of a minority group achieving 
parity as the group shrinks.

<font size="3.5"> **Text mining for social science – The state and the future of computational text analysis in sociology** </font>
 <br/>  
 
<font size="2.5">*Article published in Social Science Research available [here](https://authors.elsevier.com/sd/article/S0049-089X(22)00090-4).*</font>

<font size = "2.5">
The emergence of big data and computational tools has introduced new possibilities 
for using large-scale textual sources in sociological research. Recent work in 
sociology of culture, science, and economic sociology has shown how computational 
text analysis can be used in theory building and testing. This review starts with 
an introduction of the history of computer-assisted text analysis in sociology and 
then proceeds to discuss five families of computational methods used in contemporary
research. Using exemplary studies, it shows how dictionary methods, semantic and
network analysis tools, language models, unsupervised, and supervised machine 
learning can assist sociologists with different analytical tasks. After presenting
recent methodological developments, this review summarizes several important 
implications of using large datasets and computational methods to infer complex
meaning in texts. Finally, it calls researchers from different methodological 
traditions to adopt text mining tools while remaining mindful of lessons learned 
from working with conventional data and methods. </font>

<font size="4"> **Text mining individual states in short texts** </font>

<font size = "2.5">
Sociologists have successfully used text mining to investigate discourse using news
articles, official documents, and other sources. Yet, the potential of exploring 
millions of short texts generated spontaneously by individuals in online environments
has remained untapped within the field. To fill this gap, we show how such texts 
can inform sociologists about individual internal states such as norms, motives, 
and stances, which thus far have been mainly elicited using surveys. We assess 
the performance of 581 variations of three text mining approaches–dictionary methods,
supervised, and unsupervised machine learning–against the benchmark of texts 
coded by humans for complex schemes capturing individuals’ internal states. 
Our analysis includes coding feedback texts from an online market for motives for
leaving feedback (N = 2,000) and tweet texts for moral values expressed in text 
(N = 3,832). We describe challenges arising with these different approaches and 
provide best-practice advice for future applications.</font>
