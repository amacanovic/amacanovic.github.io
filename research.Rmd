<font size="5.5"> Cooperation and trust in extra-legal contexts </font>
  
<font size="3.5"> I explore how agents sustain mutually beneficial cooperative
  relations in adverse contexts. Illegal 
  online marketplaces (cryptomarkets) present a unique context for studying
  the emergence of cooperation in a context where legal controls are absent,
  social actors are highly anonymous, and the overall levels of trust are low.
  With collaborators, I study how socio-technical solutions (such as reputation systems) and 
  informal mechanisms of social control (such as gossip) allow individuals to 
  establish trade in such adverse extra-legal environments.

  In this work, we explore how reputation-based online markets have shifted the 
    role that psychological mechanisms play in promoting mutually cooperative
    market exchange from the stage of exchange to the stage of sharing information
    about other traders in the market. We use text mining to infer reasons traders
    had for sharing reputation information about other traders in illegal online marketplaces 
    and zoom in on the essential tole of moral norms in solving the
    second-order cooperation problem in large-scale anonymous internet marketplaces.

   Sharing of reputational information in large-scale online markets has been mainly delegated to socio-technical solutions such as reputation systems. Reputation systems have been shown to incentivize trustworthy trader behavior by collecting and transmitting information about trader reputations. However, beyond relying on quantitative scores in reputation systems, traders in online markets make use of informal community spaces for interactive, gossip-like production of information about trader reputations. We show how reputation information shared in informal communities helps govern online markets for illegal goods through two mechanisms. We combine manual text coding and deep learning language models to complement data on hundreds of thousands of market transactions with sentiments extracted from 1.6 million community texts written about traders in two illegal online markets. First, we find that reputational information shared in informal communities complements formalized reputation systems, thereby supporting informal social control. Second, we observe that community-generated information helps platform administrators to exhibit formal control by identifying and excluding untrustworthy sellers from the marketplace. We show how, beyond reliance on sophisticated reputation systems that quantify reputations, traders still rely on informal, gossip-like discussions when governing cooperative exchanges in online markets. Our work sheds light on the ecosystem of bottom-up and top-down mechanisms of social control in large-scale anonymous market environments.

<font size="5.5"> Norm emergence and change </font>
  
<font size = "3.5"> I am interested in how norms emerge to promote or block
sucesfull cooperation in societies. In a project with collaborators, I use agent-based 
models to explore how norms that signal group belonging emerge to solve cooperation problems
in contexts where multiple groups with conflicting interests encounter each other.
In such contexts, signalling one's group behaviour can help establish parochial
cooperation and benefit exploited minority groups. I am further interested in understanding 
conditions under which such signalling norms  become inefficient and 
damage the well-being of the groups that enforce them.

Mechanisms of social control reinforce norms that appear harmful or wasteful, such as mutilation practices or extensive body tattoos. We suggest such norms arise to serve as signals that distinguish between ingroup “friends” and outgroup “foes”, facilitating parochial cooperation. Combining insights from research on signalling and parochial cooperation, we incorporate a trust game with signalling in an agent-based model to study the dynamics of signalling norm emergence in groups with conflicting interests. Our results show that costly signalling norms emerge from random acts of signalling in minority groups that benefit most from parochial cooperation. Majority groups are less likely to develop costly signalling norms. Yet, norms that prescribe sending costless group identity signals can easily emerge in groups of all sizes – albeit, at times, at the expense of minority group members. Further, the dynamics of signalling norm emergence differ across signal costs, relative group sizes, and levels of ingroup assortment. Our findings provide theoretical insights into norm evolution in contexts where groups develop identity markers in response to environmental challenges that put their interests at odds with the interests of other groups. Such contexts arise in zones of ethnic conflict or during contestations of existing power relations.

<font size="5.5"> Networks, culture, innovation and inequality </font>
  
<font size="3.5"> I am intrigued by how the structure of social networks affects 
outcomes in different social groups and communities. On the one hand, I am
interested in how social network structure and cultural integration affect
the capacity of (online) communities to develop shared culture and
innovate. On the other hand, I am also intrigued by how numerical properties 
of different social groups engaging ininteractions with each other can lead to 
structural inequalities.

Structural and Cultural Pathways to Novelty Introduction in an Online Community ** </font>
  <br/>  
    
  <font size="2.5">*With Damiano Morando, In preparation.*</font>
    
<font size = "2.5">
Online communities play a crucial role in generating and spreading innovation
which affects both the online and offline world. Yet, we still know relatively little
about the members who introduce novelty into the community - innovators. We explore 
the structural and cultural embeddedness of members who introduce linguistic and 
knowledge-based innovations into a large online forum. First, we find that the 
effect of being structurally embedded in the community is moderated by the content
one is exposed to. That is, less embedded individuals (i.e., brokers) benefit from
access to diverse content in the online community;while embedded individuals 
benefit from seeing similar content.Second, we show that being culturally embedded
in the community has an inverse U shape effect over the likelihood 
introducing an innovation. We find evidence for the tension between the 
norm-following required for meaningful innovations and the norm-breaking 
that pushes one to “think outside of the box”.

<font size="3.5"> **Minority group size moderates inequity-reducing strategies in homophilic networks** </font>
  <br/>  
    
<font size = "2.5">*With Sam Zhang, In preparation.*</font>
    
<font size = "2.5">
Minorities are often disadvantaged in social networks, and their disadvantage
can arise in the presence of two ubiquitous features of social networks: homophily
and preferential attachment. This disadvantage often translates to less visibility
and lower access to valuable social capital of minority group members. In this 
paper, we use the directed network model with preferential attachment and homophily 
(DPAH) to evaluate how minority groups fare in the presence of additional groups
that could bridge the majority/minority gap, such as majority group members who 
support the minority group (allies), and minority group members that are incorporated 
into the majority group. Our results show that the marginal benefit of majority group
members becoming allies increases with minority group size, and larger minority 
groups reach equity with a smaller proportion of incorporated members. 
These results suggest that interventions on structural inequities on networks 
can depend sensitively on the relative sizes of the groups involved. 
Our models also reveal the increasing difficulty of a minority group achieving 
parity as the group shrinks.

The emergence of big data and computational tools has introduced new possibilities 
for using large-scale textual sources in sociological research. Recent work in 
sociology of culture, science, and economic sociology has shown how computational 
text analysis can be used in theory building and testing. This review starts with 
an introduction of the history of computer-assisted text analysis in sociology and 
then proceeds to discuss five families of computational methods used in contemporary
research. Using exemplary studies, it shows how dictionary methods, semantic and
network analysis tools, language models, unsupervised, and supervised machine 
learning can assist sociologists with different analytical tasks. After presenting
recent methodological developments, this review summarizes several important 
implications of using large datasets and computational methods to infer complex
meaning in texts. Finally, it calls researchers from different methodological 
traditions to adopt text mining tools while remaining mindful of lessons learned 
from working with conventional data and methods. </font>

<font size = "2.5">
Short texts generated by individuals in online environments can provide social and behavioural scientists with rich insights into individual internal states. We assess the performance of a broad set of approaches from two families of text mining methods to capture individuals’ motives, norms, emotions, and stances. The benchmark for our assessment are posts from various online platforms that were coded by humans based on theoretically informed coding schemes. We find that dictionary methods that are frequently used in the social and behavioural sciences provide unsatisfactory performance. We further assess the performance of several cutting edge supervised machine learning methods. We find that transformer language models approach our benchmark, but sometimes provide little improvement compared to simpler methods. Our analyses rely exclusively on accessible and flexible open-source transformer models. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of transformer models and address questions related to tradeoffs between complexity and performance in social and behavioral science applications. More broadly, we describe challenges arising when using different text mining approaches and provide best-practice advice. </font>
