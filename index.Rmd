I am a PhD Candidate in Sociology at the Department of Sociology, Utrecht 
University (UU) and the Interuniversity Center for Social Science Theory and 
Methodology [(ICS)](http://ics-graduateschool.nl/). My research is concerned with cooperation of agents in extra-legal 
environments and the potential negative consequences of such cooperation. 
Currently, I am exploring the functioning of reputation systems in cryptomarkets 
utilizing automatic text analysis. I am working under the supervision of [dr. 
Wojtek Przepiorka](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/WPrzepiorka) and 
[prof.dr. Vincent Buskens](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/vbuskens). 

I am the Student Representative of the Rationality and Society Section of the
American Sociological Association for 2022-2023. I am also a Junior Member of
Centre for Complex Systems Studies (CCSS) of the Utrecht University.

My areas of interest include trust and cooperation, social norms, economic sociology, and
sociology of culture. I am particularly interested in how individuals across 
different social groups and contexts come to trust each other and successfully cooperate, 
developing and changing shared social norms and institutions along the way. I am also intrigued by 
how numerical properties of groups can lead to structural inequalities in societies, 
and how these inequalities can be remedied. Finally, I have a substantive interest 
in how individuals and groups innovate and how communities evolve. 
To study these topics, I use computational methods, including machine learning, 
automatic text analysis, agent-based modeling, statistical models, and network analysis. 
Broadly, I am interested in the study of societies as complex systems.
