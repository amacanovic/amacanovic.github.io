I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Sociology, Radboud University (RU)
and the Interuniversity Center for Social Science Theory and 
Methodology [(ICS)](http://ics-graduateschool.nl/). I am currently working on a project
exploring gender representation of Dutch professors in newspapers and social media
with [dr. Bas Hofstra](https://www.bashofstra.com/).

Before this, I was a PhD Candidate at the Department of Sociology, Utrecht 
University (UU) under the supervision of [dr. Wojtek Przepiorka](https://equail.org/) and 
[prof.dr. Vincent Buskens](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/vbuskens). 

My areas of interest include economic sociology, innovation, inequalities,
and trust and cooperation. I am  interested in how structural inequalities arise 
in societies and how they can be addressed. I am also intrigued by the processes
of individual and group-level innovation and the evolution of norms and cultural
practices. Finally, I study how individuals from diverse social 
backgrounds come to trust each other and work together effectively, developing
and changing shared social norms and institutions along the way.

I explore these topics with the help of computational methods, including automatic
text analysis, machine learning, network analysis, and agent-based modelling. Broadly, I am interested in the study of societies as complex systems.

I was the Student Representative of the 
[Decision-Making, Social Networks, and Society](https://www.asanet.org/asa_sections/rationality-and-society/) section of the American Sociological Association for 2022-2023. I was also a
Junior Member of the [Centre for Complex Systems Studies (CCSS)](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/centre-for-complex-systems-studies-ccss/) 
of the Utrecht University and the former Vice-chair of the [Young Complexity Researchers Utrecht (YCRU)](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/centre-for-complex-systems-studies-ccss/about-us/young-complexity-researchers-utrecht-ycru).
